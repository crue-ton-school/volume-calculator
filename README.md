## HOW TO USE ##
First you want to download python (just download Python 3.8 or smth)
After you have finished downloading Python then you will need to unzip the zipped folder.
When you unzip it you want to open it in cmd, to do this watch this video and go to around 50 seconds: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgSSJQolR0E
When the cmd window opens you want to type in "python volume_calculator.py" this will run the program!
